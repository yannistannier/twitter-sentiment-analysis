Our main purpose is to build a powerful platform system for real-time data analysis of tweets on twitter trends.

We want to build a powerful system of sentiments analysis by making a database structure of tweets which is relevant about impacts and effects. The system should provide a faster way to execute Machine Learning methodologies behind data extracted from Twitter. Analysis news actuality by getting an analysis on actual trends with real stream data and building an efficient web interface to get results easily and keep a control on data continuously.
